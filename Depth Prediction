Assumption: Depth Perception and Segmentation aid each other.

Aim: 
Try to design a cooperative procedure between depth prediction and image segmentation. End goal should be that predicted
depth should have high local variations(predicted depth should not be smooth at a location, if an object at that location is not 
smooth). The segmentation should be dense hierarchical segmentation.

Approach:
1. Use multi scale windows in RGB image to enhance the depth prediction at a particular image patch.
Use cooperation between neighnouring windows for global continuity and smoothness. Using the changed depth prediction, for a 
particular foreground object, construct a hierarchical segmentation mask for the next level.
